## Search Techniques

### Double Quotes for Exact Match
Using double quotes (`""`) ensures that the search engine finds the exact phrase or word sequence.

### AND & OR Operators
- **AND**: Requires both terms to be present in the search results.
- **OR**: Allows either term to appear, making the search broader. 
  - Example: `OSINT OR HUMINT`

 

### Wildcards
Wildcards (`*`) are useful when you're unsure about a word or phrase. The search engine will fill in the missing part.
  - Example: `"The Cyber Mentor * OSINT"`

### File Type Specific Search
Use `filetype:` to filter search results by document type. It works for different formats like PDF, DOC, or TXT.
  - Example: `filetype:pdf OSINT Guide`

### Domain Exclusion
Using `-` before a domain or keyword excludes it from search results.
  - Example: `site:example.com -subdomain.example.com`

### Specialized Search Operators
- **`intitle:`** – Finds pages with the given words in the title.
- **`inurl:`** – Searches for keywords in URLs.
- **`intext:`** – Searches for keywords in the page body.
  - Example: `intitle:"OSINT techniques"`
